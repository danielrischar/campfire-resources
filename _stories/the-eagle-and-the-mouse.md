> A Scout-style fable about how even the smallest among us can make a difference.

---

Long ago, high in the mountains, there lived a **great bald eagle**.

He soared above the trees, proud and strong, and the animals below admired him — especially the tiny mouse who watched from the forest floor.

One day, as the eagle flew low near the cliffs, a strong gust of wind slammed him into the rocks. He tumbled down, wings tangled, and landed hard near a stream.

The animals all stayed hidden — **too afraid to help**. All except the little mouse.

The mouse scurried out, even though the eagle was huge and frightening. He said:

> “You helped me once by not eating me. Now I’ll help you.”

The mouse began gnawing through the vines wrapped around the eagle’s wings. He tugged, he pulled, he bit, until the eagle was free.

The great eagle stood, stretched his wings, and looked down at the tiny mouse.

> “Why would you help me?” the eagle asked.

The mouse said:

> “Even the smallest creatures can do a good turn.”

The eagle nodded slowly.

> “Then I owe you one.”

From that day on, whenever danger came near the mouse’s den, the eagle would swoop in and chase it off. They became unlikely friends — the biggest and the smallest.

And no one ever laughed at the little mouse again.

**Narrator (closing):** In Scouting, we learn that *everyone* matters. No matter how small you feel, you can always help someone bigger than you — and it just might change their life.

> [Optional: End with the Scout sign and a quiet, “Do a Good Turn Daily.”]
