> This is a true story — one small action that helped launch an entire movement.

---

Many years ago, a man named **William D. Boyce**, a successful American businessman, was visiting **London** on a foggy night. As he wandered the streets, unsure of where to go, a young boy stepped out of the mist and asked, “Can I help you, sir?”

Boyce said yes — he was trying to find his hotel. The boy nodded, led him through the dark, foggy streets, and brought him right to the door. Boyce reached into his pocket to tip the boy, but the boy refused.

> “I’m a Scout,” the boy said. “I won’t take anything for helping.”

Boyce was amazed. Who was this boy? What was this “Scout”?

The next day, he found the offices of the **British Boy Scouts**, where he met **Robert Baden-Powell**, the founder of the Scouting movement in England. He was so inspired that he took the idea back to America — and in **1910**, he founded the **Boy Scouts of America**.

No one ever found out the boy’s name. He became known only as **“The Unknown Scout.”**

> But because of one good turn, done without expecting anything in return, millions of Scouts have followed.

**Narrator (closing):** The Unknown Scout reminds us that one small, helpful act can change the world — and that a true Scout lives the Law, even when no one’s watching.
