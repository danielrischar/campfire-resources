Once, there was a scout who went to the zoo with their family. They saw all kinds of amazing animals — lions, zebras, monkeys, even a polar bear!

But near the end of the zoo path, they came to a strange building with a big warning sign:

> **"Do NOT touch the purple gorilla."**

Of course, this made the scout *very* curious.

They asked their mom, “Why not?”

Mom said, “No one knows what happens… just don’t do it.”

That night, the scout couldn’t sleep. They kept thinking about that **purple gorilla**. What would happen? Why was it so secret?

So the next day, they snuck back into the zoo. They climbed over the fence… tiptoed past the peacocks… and finally reached the purple gorilla’s cage.

Inside was a massive purple gorilla — ten feet tall, snoozing peacefully.

The scout reached out…

> And **TOUCHED THE PURPLE GORILLA.**

Suddenly — the gorilla’s eyes snapped open!  
He stood up and **ROARED**!

> “WHO DARES TOUCH THE PURPLE GORILLA?!”

The scout screamed and ran.

The gorilla climbed out of the enclosure and **chased** the scout through the zoo.  
Over the monkey cages.  
Around the giraffes.  
Through the concession stand.

> "WHO DARES TOUCH THE PURPLE GORILLA?!"

The scout ran out of the zoo and down the street. The gorilla was still chasing them!  
Through traffic! Over fences! Through a pizza shop!

> "WHO DARES TOUCH THE PURPLE GORILLA?!"

Finally, the scout ran all the way home, burst through the door, and slammed it shut!

> *KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*

The scout opened the door…

And the purple gorilla looked down and said:

> "**Tag. You're it.**"

> [Pause for laughter. Or groans. Or both.]
