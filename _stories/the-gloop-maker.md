# The Gloop Maker

In the bustling harbor of Portsmouth, where the salty air carried tales of distant lands and the cries of seagulls mingled with shouts of dockworkers, there once was a seasoned sailor returning to his ship after shore leave. He was a burly man with weathered skin and calloused hands, having spent twenty years at sea.

Just as he approached the edge of the dock on that misty morning, his boot caught on a coil of forgotten rope. The sailor slipped and tumbled awkwardly into the narrow gap of churning water between the massive hull of HMS Indomitable and the unforgiving stone of the harbor wall. 

As he splashed into the frigid water, the seven-thousand-ton vessel began to swing ominously toward the dock, pushed by an unexpected gust of wind. The gap between ship and shore narrowed with terrifying speed. The sailor would have been crushed to death like a walnut in a nutcracker had not a small man in a tattered peacoat, with remarkable presence of mind, snatched up a nearby coil of rope and thrown it with perfect accuracy.

"Grab hold!" shouted the little man, his voice carrying surprising authority despite his diminutive stature.

The sailor clutched the rope desperately as the little man braced himself against a bollard and hauled with strength that belied his size. With seconds to spare, he pulled the drenched sailor to safety just as the ship's massive hull slammed against the dock with a thunderous boom.

Gasping for breath and coughing up seawater, the sailor looked up at his rescuer—a man barely five feet tall with bright, intelligent eyes and nimble hands.

"Whew, thanks!" exclaimed the sailor, still trembling from his brush with death. "You saved my life, mate! I'd have been flatter than yesterday's pancakes if not for you. Tell me, is there anything—anything at all—I can do for you in return?"

The little man helped the sailor to his feet before responding thoughtfully.

"Well actually," he said, his eyes lighting up, "there is something. I'd dearly like to work aboard ship. I've always longed for a life at sea, hearing the waves and feeling the deck beneath my feet. In fact, I was just on my way to look for a position when I spotted you in trouble. If you could put in a word for me with your superiors, I'd be greatly obliged."

"Done!" declared the sailor without hesitation. "It's the least I can do!"

The grateful sailor escorted his rescuer up the gangplank, past the curious glances of the watch, and into the labyrinthine passageways of the great vessel. They eventually tracked down the Petty Officer, a stern-faced man with meticulously trimmed sideburns who was reviewing duty rosters in his small office.

"Sir," began the sailor, standing at attention, "this man saved my life not ten minutes ago. Pulled me from certain death between ship and shore. He really would very much like to have a position aboard. I've promised him I'd speak on his behalf."

The Petty Officer looked up from his papers, studying the small man with appraising eyes.

"Well, I don't know," he said doubtfully. "We have a full ship's complement according to regulations, but considering the circumstances... I'll certainly put in a word on his behalf to my superior." He turned to address the little man directly. "What's your trade, then? What position do you seek?"

"I'm a Gloop Maker," said the little man eagerly, standing straighter with obvious pride.

The Petty Officer's eyebrows rose slightly, but not wishing to appear ignorant in front of his subordinate or this strange civilian, he didn't ask what exactly a Gloop Maker was. Instead, he nodded gravely as if this were a profession of great importance and promised to speak to the Chief Petty Officer straightaway.

Later that afternoon, the Petty Officer approached his superior, a barrel-chested veteran with thirty years of naval service and a collection of tattoos documenting each major voyage.

"Chief," he began, "there's a matter requiring your attention. This morning a civilian saved the life of one of our seamen who fell between ship and dock. The man requests a position aboard as compensation. Do you think we could find him a job? He's a Gloop Maker."

The Chief Petty Officer stroked his beard thoughtfully, not wishing to appear ignorant by asking what in the seven seas a Gloop Maker actually was. "Hmm, unusual specialty, that. Better speak with the Warrant Officer. This may require higher authorization."

And so the request traveled upward—from the Warrant Officer to the Sub-Lieutenant, who consulted the Lieutenant, who spoke with the Lieutenant Commander, who brought it to the Commander, who mentioned it to the Executive Officer, each person in the chain of command too concerned with maintaining their dignity to admit they had absolutely no idea what a Gloop Maker did.

Finally, the request reached Captain Edward Blackwood, a distinguished officer with a chest full of medals and a reputation for unwavering decisiveness. After hearing about the civilian's heroic deed and unusual occupation, the Captain summoned the little man to his quarters.

"I understand you saved one of my men today," the Captain said warmly, shaking the little man's hand. "The Royal Navy is in your debt, sir."

"It was nothing, Captain," replied the little man humbly. "Anyone would have done the same."

"Nevertheless, I'm told you seek a position aboard as a Gloop Maker." The Captain paused, not wanting to appear ignorant of any maritime profession, no matter how obscure. "Well, consider yourself officially appointed as this vessel's Gloop Maker. I'll order the Supply Officer to provide whatever materials and equipment you require for your... craft."

The little man's face lit up with delight. "Thank you, Captain! You won't regret this decision."

When asked what he needed for his work, the little man presented a surprisingly specific list: a strong block and tackle to be fitted on the afterdeck, a small wooden stool, a set of fine hammers and chisels of various sizes, a portable furnace capable of reaching extreme temperatures, a large lump of iron weighing approximately two hundred pounds, several pounds of the finest copper, and a similar amount of pure silver.

Though the Supply Officer nearly fainted at the cost of these materials, especially the precious metals, the Captain's orders were clear. Within two days, as HMS Indomitable sailed from Portsmouth toward Gibraltar, the little man had established his mysterious workshop on the afterdeck.

Each morning after breakfast, the Gloop Maker would don a leather apron, light his furnace until it glowed with an almost supernatural intensity, and begin his meticulous work. First, he positioned the enormous lump of iron just so, measuring it from every angle before nodding with satisfaction. Then he would melt down precise amounts of copper and silver in small crucibles, carefully monitoring the temperature and consistency of each molten batch.

With remarkable dexterity, the little man applied these precious metals to the iron base. Using his hammers and chisels with the precision of a master sculptor, he added intricate copper embellishments and delicate silver filigree to the mysterious creation. Sometimes he would stand back, squint at his work, then make the tiniest adjustment with a specialized tool no larger than a sewing needle.

Day after day, the curious work continued. Crewmembers on their breaks would gather at a respectful distance, watching the Gloop Maker with fascination as his strange metallic sculpture slowly took form. It began to resemble something like a massive teardrop, or perhaps an enormous metal raindrop, covered with swirling patterns of copper and silver that caught the sunlight in mesmerizing ways. But not wishing to appear ignorant, nobody—not even the most experienced sailors who had seen wonders in every port from Shanghai to San Francisco—dared to ask the Gloop Maker what exactly he was making.

During his daily rounds, Captain Blackwood would invariably stop at the Gloop Maker's station, hands clasped behind his back, nodding appreciatively at the evolving creation.

"Coming along nicely," he would observe with authoritative vagueness. "Any idea precisely when it will be... ah... ready?"

"Oh yes, Captain," the little man would reply with absolute certainty. "On July 15th at precisely 1400 hours. That's when it will be complete and ready for its purpose. I would like the crew assembled on the afterdeck at that hour, if you please, sir. It's tradition for the commissioning of a new Gloop."

The Captain, not wishing to seem unfamiliar with such "traditions," readily agreed.

As the appointed day approached, anticipation spread throughout the ship. Sailors whispered theories about what the mysterious object might be. Some suggested it was a new type of navigation device that would revolutionize maritime travel. Others believed it might be a ceremonial object to bring good fortune to the vessel. A few were convinced it was an experimental weapon of devastating power. The ship's cook insisted it must be an advanced culinary tool for preparing exotic dishes.

And so the great day arrived—July 15th, clear and bright with a gentle breeze. The entire crew, from the lowest cabin boy to the senior officers, assembled on the afterdeck at the appointed hour. All were dressed in their finest uniforms, as befitted what they assumed must be an occasion of great significance.

The Gloop Maker, looking uncharacteristically formal in a clean shirt and his best trousers, put down his hammer and chisel for the final time. With quiet pride, he stood back and surveyed his completed masterpiece—a teardrop-shaped mass of iron, approximately three feet tall, covered with the most intricate and beautiful patterns of copper and silver that seemed to tell a thousand stories if one looked closely enough.

"Lower the block and tackle!" he commanded with unexpected authority.

Sailors quickly complied, carefully positioning the hoisting equipment above the gleaming creation. With great precision, the Gloop Maker directed them as they secured the metal object and began to lift it from the deck. The crew watched in reverent silence as the mysterious item was raised and then swung around until it hung directly over the sea off the ship's stern.

The Gloop Maker raised his hand, and a hush fell over the assembly.

"For six weeks I have labored to create this perfect Gloop," he announced solemnly. "Now, witness the culmination of my craft!"

He looked to the Captain, who nodded gravely, then turned back to the suspended creation.

"Ready!" called the Gloop Maker, raising his arm dramatically.

The crew leaned forward in anticipation.

"Steady!" he continued, building the tension.

Not a soul on deck dared breathe.

"GO!" he cried, slashing downward with his hand.

A sailor cut the rope, and the magnificent metal teardrop, with all its ornate copper and silver decorations glinting in the sunlight, plummeted toward the deep blue waters of the Atlantic.

For a split second, time seemed to stand still. Then, as the creation disappeared beneath the waves with a most satisfying sound, the Gloop Maker threw his arms wide in triumph.

"GLOOP!" exclaimed the little man with immense satisfaction, perfectly mimicking the distinctive sound they had all just heard.

The crew stood in stunned silence, then looked at one another in dawning comprehension.

And that, dear listeners, is the story of how a ship of the Royal Navy came to employ its very first—and undoubtedly last—official Gloop Maker.
