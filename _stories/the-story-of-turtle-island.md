### Intro

:::line
Okay Scouts, today I‚Äôm going to tell you a story that‚Äôs been told for hundreds and hundreds of years by the Native people who lived here before us.

This story comes from the Haudenosaunee people, who have lived in the Northeastern U.S. and parts of Canada for generations. It‚Äôs a creation story‚Äîabout animals, about bravery, and about a great big turtle. Ready?

### The Sky World

:::line
Long ago, there was no land. Only water covered everything.
:::

:::motion
[Wave hands to mimic water.]
:::

:::line
But above the water was the Sky World. In that world lived a kind woman named *Atahensic*, or Sky Woman.

One day, while digging around a tree, she fell through a hole that led to the water below!
:::

:::ask
What sound would she make when she fell?
:::

:::motion
[Let the Scouts make silly ‚Äúfalling‚Äù sounds.]
:::

:::line
But the birds saw her falling. They flew up to catch her!

They carried her gently down and placed her on the back of a giant turtle.
:::

:::motion
[Flap arms like wings.]
:::

:::ask
Can you help catch her? Flap your wings!

### The Turtle and the Animals

:::line
Turtle said: ‚ÄúI will carry her, but we must build her a home.‚Äù

The animals gathered and said, ‚ÄúWe must bring mud up from the bottom of the water. We‚Äôll spread it on Turtle‚Äôs back.‚Äù
:::

:::ask
Can you dive down to the bottom? It's deep and dark!
:::

:::line
Beaver dove down. SPLASH! ‚Ä¶ But came up with nothing.

Otter tried next. SPLASH! ‚Ä¶ Still too deep.

Then a small voice said, ‚ÄúI will go.‚Äù It was Muskrat.

Muskrat dove‚Äîdeeper than any of them. He was gone a long time‚Ä¶
:::

:::motion
[Look around quietly, pause.]
:::

:::line
Then ‚Äî BLOOP! He surfaced, holding mud in his paw!

Sky Woman took the mud and spread it across Turtle‚Äôs back‚Ä¶ and it began to grow.

It grew into hills‚Ä¶ and rivers‚Ä¶ and forests‚Ä¶

And that land is called‚Ä¶ Turtle Island.
:::

:::motion
[Stretch arms out slowly to show expansion.]
:::

:::ask
What do you think that land turned into?
:::

:::line
That land is where we live today. Turtle Island is another name for **North America**.
