> A repeat-after-me campfire story that builds suspense and ends with a groan or a giggle. The delivery makes or breaks it!

**Instructions:**  
Tell the audience to echo every line you say, **exactly**, like the voice of the forest. You can do it slowly, dramatically, or even with a whisper.

**Narrator (grinning):**  
The forest echo was getting annoyed! So I ran all the way back to camp and promised Iâ€™d only talk to my sleeping bag.

## ðŸ§  Delivery Tips

- Use a **spooky or echoey voice** for your own lines
- Encourage the audience to echo *with enthusiasm* (or spookiness!)
- For older Scouts, ham it up and do a second version with a *groaner twist* at the end
