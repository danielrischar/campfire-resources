## ðŸŽµ Song: The Grand Old Duke of York

**Instructions:**
This is a marching and movement song. Scouts can act out the directions by standing up, sitting down, and going halfway down as the lyrics say.

**Lyrics:**

> Oh, the grand old Duke of York,  
> He had ten thousand men,  
> He marched them up to the top of the hill,  
> And he marched them down again.  
>
> And when they were up, they were up,  
> And when they were down, they were down,  
> And when they were only halfway up,  
> They were neither up nor down!

**Actions:**
- Stand up when "up"
- Sit down when "down"
- Crouch halfway when "halfway up"
- This is a great repeat-after-me or call-and-response song!

**Notes:**
- Can be repeated faster each time for added fun.
- Perfect for getting wiggles out during a campfire or den meeting.
- Works great with all ages, especially Lions and Tigers who enjoy physical movement.
