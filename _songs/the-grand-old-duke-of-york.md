> Oh, the grand old Duke of York,  
> He had ten thousand men,  
> He marched them up to the top of the hill,  
> And he marched them down again.  
>
> And when they were up, they were up,  
> And when they were down, they were down,  
> And when they were only halfway up,  
> They were neither up nor down!
