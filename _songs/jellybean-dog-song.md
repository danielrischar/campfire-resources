  - This is an audience participation song that uses wordplay with different types of beans.
  - Start by singing the first verse about "Rover."
  - Then ask someone in the audience their name and if they have a dog (they can make one up).
  - Whatever name they give for their dog, you'll use it in the next verse, making a pun with a type of bean.
  - Select different audience members for each verse to keep everyone engaged.
  - Examples of bean puns: Jelly/Jellybean, Jump/Jumping bean, Coffee/Coffee bean, etc.
  - Great for involving the audience and creating laughs during a campfire program.
