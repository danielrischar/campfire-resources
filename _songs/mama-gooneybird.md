instructions: |
  - This is an action song where everyone follows the leader's movements.
  - Start with the basic "gooneybird" motion (elbows bent at sides, flapping arms like wings).
  - Each verse adds a new action while continuing previous actions.
  - By the end, everyone is doing multiple silly actions at once.
  - Great for burning energy and getting laughs during a campfire or pack meeting.

*Note: Additional verses can be added with more actions like "wiggled their tails," "stuck out their tongues," "turned around in circles," etc. You can add as many verses/actions as your group can handle before dissolving into laughter!*
