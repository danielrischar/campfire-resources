  - Scouts touch each body part as they sing the words.
  - For added fun, repeat the song, getting faster each time.
  - Can be sung with actions but no words in later rounds (just do the motions).
  - Perfect for Lion and Tiger dens who need to burn energy.
  - The adult leader variation ("Head, Shoulders, Belly, Belt") is a fun twist for older scouts or leaders.
