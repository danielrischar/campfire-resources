> A totally ridiculous chant-story that gets everyone yelling and laughing. No logic required — just volume and enthusiasm!

---

**Instructions:**  
Tell the Scouts to repeat **everything you say** in the same tone and volume. You can even add motions or faces to go with each line.

---

**Story Begins:**

> I said a *boom-chicka-boom!*  
> (Let them repeat)

> I said a *boom-chicka-rocka-chicka-rocka-chicka-boom!*  
> (Repeat)

> Uh-huh!  
> Oh yeah!  
> One more time...

> A little bit **louder!**  
> (Or slower, or in a silly voice, etc.)

---

Now tell the *“story”* part — line by line:

> Once upon a time...  
> There was a great big moose...

> He liked to drink a lot of juice...  
> He drank it all day long...

> And now he sings this silly song...

> [Then repeat the chant again!]  
> *Boom-chicka-boom...* etc.

---

**Narrator (closing):**  
> "The End. Or is it?"

> [Optional: Run off yelling "BOOM CHICKA MOOSE!" and let the kids echo it.]

## 🧠 Why it Works

- No lines to memorize — just echo
- Can escalate in volume, speed, pitch, silly voices
- Great for **early campfire energy** or for **resetting a sleepy group**

Want a spooky version? Or one where the lines build toward a groaner punchline? I’ve got more patterns like this that mix *chant, comedy,* and *call-and-response* for all ages!
