## ðŸŽ­ Skit: Long Pole

### Notes
- A classic skit about overthinking a simple problem
- Works well with 4-5 scouts (one "simple" scout and several "smart" scouts)
- Props are optional but can add to the humor
- Good for Bear scouts and up as it connects to STEM concepts
- Can be performed with minimal preparation

### Script

**(All scouts gather around an imaginary flagpole)**

> **Scout 1:** *(looking up)* We need to figure out how tall this flagpole is for our project.

**(Scouts 1-3 look thoughtful, studying the imaginary flagpole)**

> **Scout 2:** I know! We can measure the angle from a set distance away, then use trigonometry to calculate the height!

**(Scout 2 steps back and pretends to measure angles, scribbling calculations)**

> **Scout 2:** If the angle is 65 degrees from 20 feet away, then the height should be... hmm, this is complicated.

> **Scout 3:** *(looking at the ground)* Wait, I have a better idea! We can measure the shadow of the pole, and then measure our own shadows. If I'm 5 feet tall and my shadow is 3 feet long, and the pole's shadow is 15 feet long, then we can set up a proportion!

**(Scout 3 pretends to measure shadows and calculate)**

> **Scout 3:** So if 5 is to 3 as x is to 15, then... let's see...

**(Scout 4, who has been watching silently, finally speaks up)**

> **Scout 4:** Why don't we just take the flagpole down and measure it directly?

**(All other scouts stop and stare at Scout 4)**

> **Scout 1:** *(condescendingly)* That's ridiculous!

> **Scout 2:** *(shocked)* We can't do that!

> **Scout 3:** *(explaining slowly)* We need to know the HEIGHT of the flagpole...

> **Scout 4:** *(confused)* Yes?

> **Scout 1:** *(exasperated)* If we take it down and measure it, we'd only know the LENGTH!

**(All scouts except Scout 4 nod in agreement and return to their complicated measurements. Scout 4 looks at the audience with a confused shrug)**

**(Scouts exit, still arguing about the best way to calculate the height)**
