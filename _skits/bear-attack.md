## 🐻 Skit: Bear Attack

### Notes:
- Exaggerated movement and timing make this one shine — make the attacks comically over-the-top but safe.
- Great chance for background sound effects or "bear growls."
- You can repeat the attack once or twice for a build-up, depending on audience reaction.
- Older Scouts may be tempted to make the bear attack too violent, adult leaders should reign them in and remind them of the Scout Law.

### Setting
A camping area with a one-person tent or sleeping space marked on the floor. One scout is "inside" the tent, the other "outside" next to it.

### Script

**Scout 1:** I told you, there's only room for one of us in the tent!

**Scout 2:** Then I’m sleeping in it. You can sleep outside.

*(They settle down to sleep — Scout 2 lies inside the tent, Scout 1 outside.)*

**Enter bears** — they creep up on Scout 1 and **beat on him comically** for a few seconds, then run offstage.

*(Scout 1 sits up groaning and limps over to Scout 2.)*

**Scout 1:** I just got attacked! Please, can we switch spots?

**Scout 2:** No way. I’m already settled. Just go back to sleep.

*(Scout 1 reluctantly lies back down. Bears return and beat him again.)*

**Scout 1:** (getting up, limping worse) Okay, this is serious. Please, let’s trade!

**Scout 2:** Fine, fine. We’ll switch.

*(They swap sleeping spots. Scout 2 now lies outside.)*

**Enter bears again. One starts to approach Scout 2, but stops and points.)*

**Bear 1:**  
> “Hey… we’ve beat this one up enough — let’s get the one in the tent!”

**(They rush past Scout 2 and attack Scout 1 again.)**
