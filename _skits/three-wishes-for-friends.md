### Script

**(Three scouts are walking together when they find a lamp)**

**(First scout picks it up and rubs it)**

**(Fourth scout jumps out as the Genie)**

> **Genie:** I am the Genie of the lamp! You have released me, and as a reward, I will grant each of you one wish!

> **Scout 1:** Wow! I wish I was relaxing on a beautiful beach in Hawaii with the waves crashing and the sun shining!

**(Scout 1 acts excited, then pretends to disappear with a "poof" sound effect)**

> **Genie:** Your wish is granted!

**(Scout 1 steps aside or exits, acting like they're at the beach - putting on sunscreen, relaxing, etc.)**

> **Scout 2:** That's amazing! I wish I was at Disney World, riding all the best rides and meeting all the characters!

**(Scout 2 acts excited, then pretends to disappear with a "poof" sound effect)**

> **Genie:** Your wish is granted!

**(Scout 2 steps aside or exits, acting like they're at Disney World - pointing at attractions, taking photos, etc.)**

**(Scout 3 looks around, suddenly realizing they're all alone)**

> **Genie:** And what is your wish?

**(Scout 3 looks sad)**

> **Scout 3:** I really miss my friends... I wish I was with my friends.

**(Scout 1 and Scout 2 walk back in looking annoyed/disappointed)**

> **Genie:** Your wish is granted!

> **Scout 1:** *(upset)* Hey! I was just about to go swimming!

> **Scout 2:** *(disappointed)* I was just about to meet Mickey Mouse!

**(All scouts exit, with Scout 1 and 2 glaring at Scout 3, who shrugs apologetically)**
