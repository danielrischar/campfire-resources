## ðŸŽ­ Skit: The World's Best Tree Climber

### Notes
- Works well with 3-5 scouts (one offstage as the climber)
- Can be performed with minimal preparation
- The offstage climber needs a good falling scream and ability to make a loud "thump" sound
- Consider using a guidebook or smartphone with actual tree facts for authenticity
- Fun skit that builds up to a surprising punchline

### Script

**(A group of scouts walk onstage, looking around excitedly)**

> **Scout 1:** I heard the world's best tree climber is practicing around here today!

> **Scout 2:** No way! I've always wanted to see someone climb super high!

**(All scouts look around, then Scout 1 cups hands around mouth)**

> **Scout 1:** *(calling out)* Hello? Mr. Tree Climber? Are you here?

**(Voice from offstage - the Climber)**

> **Climber:** *(from offstage)* Yes, I'm up here! I'm the world's greatest tree climber!

**(Scouts all look up, shading their eyes)**

> **Scout 3:** Wow! How high are you right now?

> **Climber:** *(from offstage)* I'm currently at 100 feet up!

> **Scout 2:** *(impressed)* That's amazing! Can you go higher?

> **Climber:** *(from offstage)* Sure thing! *(pause)* Now I'm at 200 feet!

**(Scouts all react with amazement)**

> **Scout 1:** Higher! Can you go even higher?

> **Climber:** *(from offstage)* Of course! *(pause)* Now I'm at 300 feet!

> **Scout 3:** Incredible! How about 400 feet?

> **Climber:** *(from offstage)* Easy! *(pause)* 400 feet now!

**(Scout 2 pulls out a book/smartphone and starts looking something up)**

> **Scout 2:** *(reading)* Hey guys, it says here that the tallest tree in the world is the Hyperion, a coast redwood that's only 379.7 feet tall.

**(All scouts look at each other with concern, then slowly look up again)**

> **Climber:** *(from offstage, loud scream)* AAAAAAHHHHHHH!

**(Loud thump sound effect)**

**(All scouts wince, then tiptoe off stage, looking guilty)**
