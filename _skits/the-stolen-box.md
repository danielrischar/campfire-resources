## 🎭 Skit: The Stolen Box

### Notes
- Requires 5 scouts (manager, guard, and 3 workers)
- The humor comes from the ironic twist at the end
- Simple props needed - just empty boxes with cloth coverings
- Good for teaching about irony and misunderstandings
- Can be elaborated with additional details if desired
- Works well for Bear scouts and up

### Script

**(Manager and Guard enter stage)**

> **Manager:** *(To new guard)* I'm giving you the very responsible position of gate guard at this factory. Because of the lack of vigilance by your predecessors, the workers have stolen so many finished articles that the firm is heading for bankruptcy. Your duty is to ensure this is brought to an end. Do you understand?

> **Guard:** Yes Sir. I am to stop stealing.

> **Manager:** That's right. You can search people if necessary. Now it's up to you, and let's see some results.

> **Guard:** Very good, Sir.

**(Manager leaves; Guard takes post; first workman enters carrying a cloth-draped box)**

> **Guard:** Just a moment. What have you got in that box?

> **Worker 1:** What do you mean?

> **Guard:** What have you got in that box? It's my duty to see that no one takes stuff out of the factory.

> **Worker 1:** There's nothing in the box. Look!

**(Worker 1 shows everyone the box is empty)**

> **Guard:** Oh, well, that's all right then.

**(Worker 1 leaves and Worker 2 enters, box draped as before)**

> **Guard:** Hold it! What's in the box?

> **Worker 2:** Nothing at all. See for yourself.

**(Guard inspects the empty box carefully)**

> **Guard:** Alright, you can go.

**(Worker 2 leaves and Worker 3 enters with another draped box)**

> **Guard:** Stop right there! I need to check your box.

> **Worker 3:** Sure, it's completely empty.

**(Guard looks in the box and finds nothing)**

> **Guard:** Proceed.

**(Worker 3 leaves. Immediately after, the Manager races in looking enraged)**

> **Manager:** *(furious)* I hired you to stop this pilfering. You've only been here half an hour and already we're losing things!

> **Guard:** *(confused)* But the only people who went out were three men with boxes. I stopped them all and they all had nothing in them.

> **Manager:** *(exasperated)* We're a box factory!

**(Guard looks confused, then realizes his mistake as Manager puts head in hands)**
