**(Ole and Sven walk on stage, looking around at the ground.)**

**Ole:** Sven, dis looks like a goot spot.

**Sven:** Ya, Ole, let’s start here, den.

**(Sven starts miming drilling a hole in the ice with effort.)**

**God’s Voice (booming):** There are no fish there!

**(Both scouts jump and look around in shock.)**

**Ole:** Sven, let’s try over der.

**Sven:** Ya, Ole, you drill da hole dis time.

**(They move a few steps. Ole starts to drill.)**

**God’s Voice:** There are no fish there!

**(They jump again and look worried.)**

**Ole:** My gosh, Sven, we’d best try a different spot I’m thinkin’.

**Sven:** Ya, Ole, dat looks pretty good over der.

**(They move once more and start drilling again.)**

**God’s Voice:** Listen, you guys —  
**I’m the ice rink manager, and THERE ARE NO FISH THERE!**

**Notes:**
- The punchline depends on the buildup and serious tone of the voice.
- Great as an opener or mid-campfire skit.
- The "God’s voice" can be delivered over a mic or loudly from offstage.
- Keep accents light-hearted and clear — the joke works best if everyone understands the lines.
