## ðŸ“» Skit: Emergency Broadcast System

### Note
This skit is excellent for younger scouts.  They have no speaking parts, love to make the loud noises, and you can cut them off with hand motion (and its funny when they don't stop on queue).

**Setup:** All scouts but one stand in a straight line. The leader stands to one side or out in front.

**Leader:** For the next ten seconds, we will conduct a test of the Emergency Broadcast System.

*(All scouts in line loudly say "Beeeeeeeeeeep" in unison. After about ten seconds, the leader raises their hand and the scouts go silent.)*

**Leader**
Thank you. This concludes the test of the emergency broadcast system. Had this been an actual emergency, you would have heard...

*(line of scouts scream in panic and run around)*
