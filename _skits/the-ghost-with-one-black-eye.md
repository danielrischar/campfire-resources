## ðŸ‘» The Ghost with One Black Eye

### Cast
- One or two **scouts in a tent**
- One scout as the **ghost** (wears a sheet or stands off stage)
- Optional additional scouts for audience or echo effects

### Setting
A campsite at night. The tent is center stage. The ghost is offstage to begin.

### Script

1. Scouts are in the tent, pretending to go to sleep.

   - **Scout 1:** "Goodnight!"
   - **Scout 2:** "Shhh! I'm trying to sleep!"

2. Suddenly, the ghost enters (from offstage), moving creepily.

   - **Ghost:** "Iâ€¦ amâ€¦ the ghostâ€¦ with oneâ€¦ blackâ€¦ eyeâ€¦"

3. The scouts scream, pull their blankets over their heads.

4. The ghost disappears.

5. Repeat this *two or three times*, building suspense.

   - Each time, the ghost gets louder or more dramatic.
   - Maybe add some fog noises or creaking sounds.

6. On the final visit, the ghost steps forward:

   - **Ghost (booming):** "Iâ€¦ amâ€¦ the ghostâ€¦ with oneâ€¦ blackâ€¦ eyeâ€¦"

7. The scouts sit up, clearly annoyed:

   - **Scout 1 (yelling):**  
     "And if you don't let us sleepâ€¦"

   - **Scout 2 (joining in):**  
     "**You'll be the ghost with TWO black eyes!!**"

8. The ghost gasps, screams in fear, and runs away!

**Notes:**

- The humor is in the *build-up and timing* â€” make the ghost increasingly spooky, but always just a little too slow.
- Kids will love yelling the final line together.
- Easy for Lions and Tigers to remember and act out.
