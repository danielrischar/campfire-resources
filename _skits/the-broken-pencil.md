## ✏️ Skit: The Broken Pencil

### Cast
- **Scout 1**: Investigator
- **Scout 2**: Concerned Scout
- Optional: Additional “helpers” or “witnesses”

### Setting
An “investigation” scene, like a detective show.

### Script

1. **Scout 1** steps forward dramatically, holding a clipboard.

   - **Scout 1**: "I’m Detective Doodle, and I’m here to solve a serious case. Something terrible has happened."

2. **Scout 2** enters, looking worried.

   - **Scout 2**: "Detective! What’s wrong? What happened?"

   - **Scout 1**: *(very serious)* "There’s been a break... a terrible break..."

   - **Scout 2**: "Oh no! A broken window? A broken promise??"

   - **Scout 1**: *(holds up the pencil)* "No... a broken pencil."

3. **Scout 2**: "A pencil? That’s it?"

   - **Scout 1**: "Yes. It’s pointless."

   *(Pause for groans or laughs)*

4. Optional: Other Scouts enter, reacting dramatically.

   - **Scout 3**: "Pointless?! Nooooo!"
   - **Scout 4**: *(pretends to faint)*

5. **Scout 1** shrugs and walks off.

   - **Scout 1**: "Case closed."

**Notes:**
- This skit is built around a pun and dramatic delivery.
- No memorization needed — Scouts can read off clipboards if they want!
- Optional flair: trench coat, sunglasses, or oversized props for the “detective.”
- Great short filler between longer acts at a campfire.
