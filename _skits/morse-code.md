### Notes
- A quick, simple skit with only two scouts
- Can be performed with no props, though a flashlight can be used for effect
- Can be performed as written or adapted for "smoke signals" variant
- Works well as a short interlude between longer skits
- Introduces scouts to the concept of morse code in a humorous way
- Minimal preparation required

### Script

**(Two scouts walk in. First scout points into the distance.)**

> **Scout 1:** Hey, look way off over there. What's that flashing light?

**(Both scouts shield eyes and peer into the distance)**

> **Scout 2:** Hey, I think that might be morse code. You know how you can use short and long flashes or sounds to spell out letters.

> **Scout 1:** *(impressed)* Wow! What is it saying?

**(Scout 2 looks intently, perhaps mimicking the flashing light pattern with hand movements)**

> **Scout 2:** *(pausing between words)* Help ... my ... headlamp ... won't â€¦ stay â€¦ on!

**(Both scouts look at each other, then at the audience with a shrug, and exit)**
