## ðŸŽ­ Skit: Injured Scout

### Notes
- Only requires 2 scouts to perform
- Works well at camps with difficult-to-spell names (like)
- Can be adapted to local names based on where the performance is taking place
- Gentle irony about emergency preparedness and communication
- Simple enough for younger scouts to perform, but also works with older scouts

### Script

**(Two scouts enter, hiking along a trail)**

**(First Scout trips dramatically and falls)**

> **Scout 1:** *(grabbing leg and wincing in pain)* Owww! I think I hurt my leg!

> **Scout 2:** *(concerned)* Don't worry! I have my cell phone with me. I'll call for help!

**(Scout 2 pulls out phone and pretends to dial)**

> **Scout 2:** Hello? Emergency services? We need help! My friend hurt his leg while hiking.

**(Pause as if listening)**

> **Scout 2:** Where are we? We're at Camp Beaumont.

**(Pause)**

> **Scout 2:** *(slowly)* B-E-A... um... B-E-O-M... no wait...

**(Looks frustrated, tries again)**

> **Scout 2:** B-E-A-U... hmm... B-O-M-O-N-T?

**(Looks at Scout 1, shrugs)**

> **Scout 2:** You know what? Never mind. We'll just hike to Firelands. It's easier to spell!

> **Scout 1:** *(still holding injured leg)* Good idea!

**(Scout 1 gets up, limps dramatically, and both scouts exit together)**

> **Scout 2:** *(as they're leaving)* Next time let's just hike someplace with a shorter name!
