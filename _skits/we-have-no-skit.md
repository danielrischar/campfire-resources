## ðŸŽ­ Skit: We Have No Skit!

### Notes
- Great filler skit or emergency backup if Scouts are short on time.
- Can be performed with any number of Scouts.
- Works even better if each Scout reacts bigger and more dramatically than the last.
- Audience usually groans or laughs â€” itâ€™s a classic Cub Scout misdirection gag!

### Script

**(Scout 1 walks to center stage, looks shocked, slaps forehead dramatically.)**

> **Scout 1:** Oh no!!

**(Scout 2 runs up.)**

> **Scout 2:** Whatâ€™s wrong?

**(Scout 1 whispers into Scout 2â€™s ear. Scout 2 gasps.)**

> **Scout 2:** Oh no!!

**(Scout 3 runs in.)**

> **Scout 3:** Whatâ€™s wrong?

**(Scout 2 whispers to Scout 3, who also reacts.)**

> **Scout 3:** Oh no!!

*(Continue this chain for as many scouts as you have.)*

**(Finally, the last Scout runs up, excited to find out whatâ€™s going on.)**

> **Last Scout:** Whatâ€™s wrong??

**(All the other Scouts shout together):**

> **ALL:** We have no skit!!!
