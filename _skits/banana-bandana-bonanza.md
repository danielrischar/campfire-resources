## ðŸŽ­ Skit: Banana Bandana Bonanza

### Notes
- This skit's humor is based on mistaking the term "bandana" for "banana"
- Perfect for younger scouts (Lions/Tigers) who can't easily manage lines
- Scouts mostly pantomime actions rather than speaking
- Works well with any number of scouts
- Can use real bananas, but fake/stress-ball bananas won't create a mess or waste food
- Can be modified to have one scout with a banana and others with actual bandanas

### Script

**(Scouts line up on stage with bananas hidden behind their backs. Leader stands to the side where they can be seen by audience but not by the scouts.)**

> **Leader:** Ok scouts, we've learned about the 6 essentials, but there is one more item that is always useful to have on your person when camping or hiking, and that item is a bandana! [Lions/Tigers/etc.] pull out your bandanas.

**(The scouts look confused, then pull out their bananas and hold them high)**

> **Leader:** A bandana can be used in many ways while out on the trail. It can be used to wipe sweat from your forehead and face... *(demonstrates with actual bandana)*

**(Scouts all follow and rub the bananas across their faces as if they were bandanas)**

> **Leader:** You can put it on your head and neck to protect you from the sun... *(demonstrates)*

**(Scouts attempt to put bananas on their heads/necks)**

> **Leader:** You can use it to dry your hands... *(demonstrates)*

**(Scouts mime drying hands with bananas)**

> **Leader:** You can sit on it to keep clean... *(demonstrates)*

**(Scouts attempt to sit on their bananas)**

> **Leader:** You can blow your nose... *(demonstrates)*

**(Scouts pretend to blow their noses with bananas)**

> **Leader:** You can use it for first aid or to tie a splint... *(demonstrates)*

**(Scouts attempt to wrap bananas around arms/legs)**

> **Leader:** You can use it as a flag and wave it above your head for attention... *(demonstrates)*

**(Scouts enthusiastically wave bananas over their heads)**

**(Leader finally turns around, sees the bananas, looks shocked)**

> **Leader:** I said BANDANA, not BANANA!

**(All scouts look at their bananas, then at each other, then shrug or react with exaggerated surprise)**
