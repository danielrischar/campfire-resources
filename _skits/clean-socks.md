## ðŸ§¦ Skit: Clean Socks

**Scout #1** (can be a leader): Hey, everybody! Our new socks have arrived! Come and get 'em!

*(Other scouts run onstage and line up to receive socks.)*

---

**Scout #1:** OK, Johnny, how many socks do you need?  
**Scout #2:** I need 2 pair.  
**Scout #1:** Just two?  
**Scout #2:** Yes, I wear one pair for a week while the other pair is in the dirty wash.  
**Scout #1:** Yuch! Oh well, here you go.

---

**Scout #1:** OK, next! How many do you need?  
**Scout #3:** I need 4 pair.  
**Scout #1:** Why 4 pair?  
**Scout #3:** I put on a fresh pair on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday.  
**Scout #1:** Well, that's better than wearing them a whole week. Here you go.

---

**Scout #1:** And how many for you?  
**Scout #4:** I need 7 pair.  
**Scout #1:** Great. I bet that's a fresh pair every day, right?  
**Scout #4:** Right!  
**Scout #1:** That's what I like. A clean scout! Here you go.

---

**Scout #1:** OK, last one. How many socks for you?  
**Scout #5:** 12 pair please!  
**Scout #1:** 12!? Man, you must really be clean. Why 12 pair?  
**Scout #5:** Well, thereâ€™s January, February, Marchâ€¦

*(All scouts groan or laugh. Optional: have Scout #1 chase Scout #5 offstage.)*
