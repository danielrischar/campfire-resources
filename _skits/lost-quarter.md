## 💡 Skit: The Lost Quarter

### Notes
- The "lamppost" should remain still the entire time for extra comedic effect.
- Encourage over-the-top crawling, squinting, and exaggerated frustration.
- This skit lands best when performed seriously until the punchline.
- Optional follow-up: A leader can reflect briefly on the “lesson” about doing things the right way vs. the easy way.

### Cast
- 4 or more Scouts (can easily scale up)
- 1 "lamppost" (a Scout holding a flashlight or lantern)

### Setting
A scout stands center stage holding a flashlight or lantern pointed at the ground — acting as a lamppost. Other scouts enter one at a time.

**(Scout #1 is crawling on the ground under the flashlight beam.)**

**Scout #2 (walking by):**  
> Hey, what are you looking for?

**Scout #1:**  
> I lost a quarter.

**Scout #2:**  
> Here, I’ll help you find it.

**(Scout #2 starts searching next to him. Scout #3 enters.)**

**Scout #3:**  
> What are you guys looking for?

**Scout #1:**  
> I lost a quarter.

**Scout #3:**  
> I’ll help too!

**(Scout #3 joins the search. Continue adding scouts one by one, all crawling and searching in the same lit area.)**

**Eventually, a Scout stops and asks:**

**Scout #2:**  
> Man, I just don’t see it. Are you sure you lost that quarter here?

**Scout #1:**  
> No, I lost it over there. *(points offstage)*

**Scout #2:**  
> What?! Then why are we searching over here?

**Scout #1:**  
> Because the light’s better over here!
