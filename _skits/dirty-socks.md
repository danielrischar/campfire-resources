## 🧦 Skit: Dirty Socks

### Setting
A large pot or can sits center stage, filled with “camp liquid.” Each scout enters one at a time with a cup.

---

**Scout 1:**  
*(Walks up to the can, dips in cup, takes a sip)*  
> “Yuch! This camp tea is awful!”

**Scout 2:**  
*(Does the same)*  
> “Yuch! This camp coffee is terrible!”

**Scout 3:**  
*(Same action)*  
> “Yuch! This camp chocolate is disgusting!”

**Scout 4:**  
*(Walks up, reaches into the can, pulls out a soggy pair of socks, wrings them out)*  
> “Aaaah, they’re finally clean!”

---

**Notes:**
- Play up the reactions — the gross-out is part of the fun.
- Socks can be clean and just
