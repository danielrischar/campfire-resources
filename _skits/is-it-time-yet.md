## ðŸŽ­ Skit: Is It Time Yet?

### Notes
- Requires 5-8 scouts
- Timing is important - the pauses should be long enough to build anticipation
- Works well as a "filler" skit during transitions
- Good for scouts who may be uncomfortable with speaking many lines
- The humor comes from the buildup and the absurd ending
- Can be performed with scouts standing in a line or sitting/lying down in a row

### Script

**(5-8 Scouts stand or lie in a line, all with their LEFT foot crossed over RIGHT and RIGHT arm crossed over LEFT. They should appear uncomfortable or strained.)**

> **Scout 1:** *(asking Scout 2)* IS IT TIME YET?

> **Scout 2:** *(turns to Scout 3)* IS IT TIME YET?

> **Scout 3:** *(turns to Scout 4)* IS IT TIME YET?

**(Continue down the line until the last Scout)**

> **Last Scout:** NO.

**(The "NO" is passed back up the line, one Scout at a time, until it reaches Scout 1)**

**(Long, awkward pause as all Scouts continue to maintain their uncomfortable position)**

> **Scout 1:** *(asking again, appearing more uncomfortable)* IS IT TIME YET?

**(Question passes down the line as before)**

> **Last Scout:** NO.

**(The "NO" is passed back up the line again to Scout 1)**

**(Another long pause, even longer than before. Scouts can wiggle, look at watches, sigh, etc.)**

> **Scout 1:** *(asking with desperation)* IS IT TIME YET?

**(Question passes down the line one more time)**

> **Last Scout:** *(with relief)* YES!

**(The "YES" is passed back up the line with increasing excitement)**

**(As soon as the "YES" reaches Scout 1, ALL Scouts simultaneously switch to RIGHT foot over LEFT and LEFT arm over RIGHT arm)**

**(All Scouts groan loudly with relief and exit, still walking awkwardly)**
