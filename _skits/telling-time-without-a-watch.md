## ðŸŽ­ Skit: Telling Time Without a Watch

### Notes
- Best performed in the evening or at night
- Requires one or two main speakers, several noisy scouts, and someone off-stage
- Off-stage person should be an adult with a loud voice
- Works well as a campfire skit where the audience expects a "trick" or clever solution
- Can involve as many scouts as needed to create commotion

### Script

**Option 1 (Single speaker):**

**(Speaker steps forward to address audience)**

> **Speaker:** I would like to demonstrate for you a special wilderness skill: how to tell time without a watch!  During the day, we can look at the sun, but what about at night?

**(Speaker signals to the scouts who begin making noise, playing games, yelling, running around, etc.)**

**(After about 15 seconds, speaker holds up the Scout sign to quiet them down. Scouts immediately stop making noise.)**

> **Speaker:** *(holding hand to ear, listening intently)* Hmm, I can't quite tell what time it is yet.

**(Speaker signals scouts again, who resume making noise, possibly even louder)**

**(Speaker repeats holding up the Scout sign, scouts quiet down)**

> **Speaker:** *(listening again)* Almost got it... but not quite.

**(Speaker signals scouts one more time for the loudest commotion yet)**

**(Just as speaker is about to hold up Scout sign to quiet them...)**

> **Off-stage Adult:** *(yelling loudly from off-stage)* HEY! IT'S [CURRENT TIME] O'CLOCK! YOU KIDS NEED TO QUIET DOWN!

**(Speaker looks at audience with a satisfied grin)**

> **Speaker:** And that's how you tell time without a watch!

**Option 2 (Two speakers):**

**(Two speakers walk to center stage)**

> **Speaker 1:** Hey, do you know what time it is?
> 
> **Speaker 2:** I don't have a watch, but I know a special wilderness technique for telling time!

**(Speaker 2 signals to the scouts who begin making noise, playing games, yelling, running around, etc.)**

**(After about 15 seconds, Speaker 2 holds up the Scout sign to quiet them down. Scouts immediately stop making noise.)**

> **Speaker 2:** *(holding hand to ear, listening intently)* Hmm, I can't quite tell what time it is yet.

**(Speaker 2 signals scouts again, who resume making noise, possibly even louder)**

**(Speaker 2 repeats holding up the Scout sign, scouts quiet down)**

> **Speaker 1:** What are you doing?
> 
> **Speaker 2:** *(listening again)* Almost got it... but not quite.

**(Speaker 2 signals scouts one more time for the loudest commotion yet)**

**(Just as Speaker 2 is about to hold up Scout sign to quiet them...)**

> **Off-stage Adult:** *(yelling loudly from off-stage)* HEY! IT'S [CURRENT TIME] O'CLOCK! YOU KIDS NEED TO QUIET DOWN!

**(Speaker 2 looks at Speaker 1 with a satisfied grin)**

> **Speaker 2:** See? That's how you tell time without a watch!
