## üí° Skit: Can't Work in the Dark

### Cast
- 4 or more Scouts doing manual labor
- 1 Scout acting as the ‚Äúlightbulb‚Äù
- 1 Boss (can be another Scout or an adult)

### Setting
A construction or work site. Scouts are digging, raking, or miming work. One scout is standing still with an arm raised as if holding a torch or bulb.

---

### Script

**(The boss walks on stage, observing the workers. He notices one scout just standing there.)**

> **Boss:** I'm paying you to work, not to just stand around. Why aren‚Äôt you working?

> **Scout #1:** I‚Äôm a lightbulb!

> **Boss:** Get to work! When I come back, if you‚Äôre not working, you‚Äôre fired!

**(Boss exits. The scouts continue working. Scout #1 keeps holding their arm up. The boss re-enters and sees no change.)**

> **Boss:** That‚Äôs it! You‚Äôre fired! Get out!

**(Scout #1 lowers their arm and walks off sadly. As soon as their arm drops, all the other scouts stop working, look around confused, and start leaving.)**

> **Boss:** Hey, why are you all leaving? Get back to work!

> **Scout #2:** How? We can‚Äôt work in the dark!

**Notes:**
- Works best with a group that can synchronize movements.
- The ‚Äúlightbulb‚Äù pose should be exaggerated and consistent.
- Optional: Use a prop flashlight, glowstick, or headlamp for added comedy.
