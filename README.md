Use the seacch functionality to fine activities that are appropriate for the age and number of Scouts you have.

## Tailored to Cub Scout Ages
The BSA program covers scouts from 4–18 and adults from 18–125. That’s a really large range of abilities and mental development.

The number one rule of any program is to tailor it to the participants and the audience. For Cub Scouts, this means making sure content can be performed and understood by 4–11 year olds.

<p>For example:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Scout 1:</strong> Never buy a “Tates” compass.<br>
    <strong>Scout 2:</strong> Why? What’s so bad about a “Tates” compass?<br>
    <strong>Scout 1:</strong> You know what they say — <em>Whoever has a Tates is lost!</em></p>
  </blockquote>

Experiences change over time, and it is suprising how many skits are around that use experiences from when the adult leaders were kids.  Consider whether a skit using a land line telephone as a major component of the humor will land with kids who may not know what that is?

## Keep the performances within the Scouts’ abilities.
* Lions and Tigers have difficulty memorizing lines or projecting their voices. They may need an adult narrator.
* Wolves and Bears may need written cards for remembering lines.
* All Scouts may be shy, and group parts are great.

## Rules for All Program Elements
Ensure that you follow the current Guide to Safe Scouting, the Age Appropriate Guidelines for Scouting Activities, and the 7 Leave No Trace Principles for all adventures involving scouts.  These guidelines are written with the input by many professionals to ensure that you provide a safe and valuable experience to your scouts.
* No name calling, put downs or hazing.  In some limited cases, a volunteer adult leader can be the target of a joke, but never a child and never without volunteering.
* No toilet humor (this should include animal skat in all but limited cases)
* No sexual overtones, nudity, references to undergarments or bodily functions
* No water skits.  Nobody gets wet, even volunteers.
* No cross gender or ethnic impersonation that is in any way derogatory or insulting.
* Do not portray violent behavior, or any behavior not in line with the Guide to Safe Scouting (eg: shooting guns at each other). This includes violence towards animals, alcohol, drugs, etc.
* Meet the ideals of the Scout Oath, Scout Law, and the Boy Scouts of America.

In addition, these are some good guidelines to ensure a successful program that is entertaining for all.
* Avoid wasteful behavior, including food and water.  No wasting of food as a prop and water should never be included anyhow.
* Do not make a mess that you cannot immediately clean up.  No silly string, glitter, confetti, or shaving cream.
* Do not appropriate other cultures unless there is a clear reason.  By this, I mean do not use accents or costumes or another culture unless it is material to the song or skit (and if it is, consider whether it is appropriate at all). See “Portraying Other Cultures” below.
* Avoid inside jokes that won’t land with the audience.
* “If in doubt, throw it out” – just take out anything that seems questionable there is plenty of content.

## Tips for Success
* Encourage the kids to face the audience when speaking rather than each other, to speak louder than they think they need to, and to over-emote (big waving arms and body movements)
* Involve the audience as much as possible.  Avoid singing to them if you can sing *with* them.
* Use repeat-after-me songs and do-as-I-do songs to increase audience participation.  For songs that do not involve repeating, think about getting cue cards so some audience members can join in, or teaching once and performing once.  Demonstrate any motions or lyrics so that the group knows what to do.
* Keep punch lines within the understanding of the age of the scouts. A skit that references land line phones may no longer make sense to Cub Scouts.
* Tailor the content to the age level of the performers.  Young cub scouts are not great at remembering lines or projecting their voice to be heard by the audience.
* Practice, practice, practice.
* If you are running the campfire, screen all acts.  Scouts may call a song or skit by a different name or use the same name for a different skit.  Ensure appropriate content by asking what they will be performing.
* Lead with enthusiasm.  Adult leaders need to go from “zero to silly” quickly.
* Encourage scouts to leave their comfort zone, public speaking is a valuable skill that takes practice to become comfortable.  But do not push too hard, there may be other ways that a scout can participate.
* Have fun.


## Portraying other Cultures
The Boy Scouts (and many other organizations) have a long history of appropriating Native American culture into ceremony.  If these ceremonies have no basis in actual Native American history, then they can quickly become patronizing caricatures or even worse: racist tropes.  Programs such as the Order of the Arrow actively work with Native organizations to help ensure that their ceremonies are done respectfully and even then, there can still be problems, so they are best to avoid altogether.

This resource should not include stories that include native elements unless that story comes from an actual native source.  Most areas of the US had a native population at one time, and it can be valuable to reach out to those groups for stories that are tied to the locale.  As an example, the BSA camp that I grew up with and worked at was named “Stigwandish” after a chief in story that is recounted here: https://case.edu/ech/articles/s/stigwanish.  This story, embellished quite a bit, was spoken towards the end of our campfires.  This story is lacking citations but is better than most and was tied directly into the local area.

Hopefully this guide helps you realize that there is more than enough content for scout programming without needing to resort to potentially hurtful or damaging tropes.
